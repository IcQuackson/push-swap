# push-swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

To sort between 5 and 100 elements I used the following algorithm:
-Divide the elements in the stack in 5 partitions;
-Send the elements of one partition before sending the ones from the next partition. The smallest elements get pushed to stack B first.
-After stack A is empty keep pushing the max element in stack B until its empty.
-Stack A should be sorted in less than 800 moves

To sort more than 100 elements I used the Radix algorithm adapted to the problem we have in hands:
-We're gonna keep pushing elements to stack B by checking them bit to bit and push them back to stack A.
-I use the elements value in binary to make the comparisons;
-Start comparing the least significant from each element in stack A and check if it's 1 or 0;
-Push the element to stack B if the bit is 0;
-Rotate stack A if the bit is 1;
-After pushing all the elements that have the current bit set to 0 push them back to to stack A;
-Go to next bit and do the same thing;
-Stop when no element in stack A has the current bit set to 1;
-Stack A should be sorted in less than 7000 moves
